### 🛠️ AR-Product-Prototype

**AR-Product-Prototype** is an ongoing augmented reality application built to support **real-time product maintenance and inspection**. Using AR, users can scan a physical component or QR code to visualize 3D models, interact with individual parts, and follow a structured maintenance checklist.

This project aims to streamline maintenance workflows, reduce human error, and provide field technicians with intuitive, on-site guidance through AR.

---

#### 🔧 Key Features (In Progress):

* Scan-based AR model visualization using image or QR targets
* Interactive part visibility toggle (e.g., isolate piston, valve, etc.)
* Maintenance checklist integrated with cloud database (e.g., Firebase)
* Burst view for component-level inspection
* Defect identification module (AI-based – coming soon)

---

#### 💼 Use Case:

Designed for **manufacturing industries**, this AR app assists technicians and engineers in inspecting complex machines, understanding internal structures, and performing guided maintenance efficiently.

---

#### 🧰 Tech Stack:

* Unity + Vuforia SDK
* Firebase (Realtime Database / Firestore)
* C# for logic and interaction
* AI integration planned for defect detection (TensorFlow Lite or custom model)

---

#### 📌 Status:

**🚧 Ongoing** – Actively under development with incremental feature additions and industry-focused testing.
